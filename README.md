React Quiz Project
Welcome to the React Quiz Project repository! This project is a dynamic quiz application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The quiz consists of 15 questions, each with a point value contributing to a total score of 280.

The repository is organized into two main folders:

Frontend (React):

Developed using Node.js, the backend handles data processing, authentication, and communication with the frontend.
